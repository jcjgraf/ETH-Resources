\subsubsection{Bit Mask}
Bit masks can be used to:
\begin{description}
    \item[Delete] and \textbf{test} bits with AND
    \item[Set] bits with OR
    \item[Flip] bits with XOR
\end{description}

Test if $i$-th bit is $1$: \code{result = (input \& (1<<i))}

Flip if $i$-th bit is $1$: \code{result = (input \^ (1<<i))}

Set if $i$-th bit is $1$: \code{result = (input | (1<<i))}
