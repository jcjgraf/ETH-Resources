        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most general term
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Confidentiality:} Keeps someone else's data secret
    \ides{Privacy:} Keep data about a person secret

        \begin{itemize}

\subsection{Intra-Domain Routing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is assumed that attacks come from the outside (inter-domain)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Therefore the is not much security in intra-domain
        \end{itemize}
    \item Compromise node (/router)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Flood any message we want
        \end{itemize}
    \item Compromise link
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Act as a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
        \end{itemize}
    \item In both cases we are able to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item View to whole network topology
            \item Inject any message they want
        \end{itemize}
    \item We can do:
        \begin{itemize}
            \ides{Interception}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Aims at eavesdropping, dropping, modifying, injection or delaying packages
                    \item By injecting fake information, we can precisely control the network-wide behaviour
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Done by flooding about non-existing (virtual) nodes and links of arbitrary cost
                        \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \ides{Denial-of-Service (DoS)}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Many different strategies
                    \item Induce churn to overload routers by announcing and withdrawing routes at a fast pace
                    \item Flood routers link-state database by injecting thousands of prefixes
                    \item Induce congestion/high delay by steering traffic along fewer or low-throughput paths
                    \item Prevent reachability by steering traffic along black holes or loops
                \end{itemize}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Problem, routers are often underspecified and certificate validation takes lot of time
                    \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Problem:} Bogus advertisements can be injected or legitimate ones can be altered
    \ides{Solution:} Use cryptic authentication
        \begin{itemize}
            \icon Routers are often underspecified for computationally  expensive verification
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inter-Domain Routing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are regularly attacked
    \item BGP lacks any security measures
    \item Problems
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Advertisement Origin Verification
                \begin{itemize}

                        \begin{itemize}

                            \ides{Snooping:} Data traffic is inspected, then redirected
                            \ides{Impersonation:} Traffic sent to bogus destinations
                        \end{itemize}
                    \ides{IP Prefix Hijacking}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item AS advertises a prefix it does not own
                            \item Some traffic is redirected to a bogus destination
                        \end{itemize}
                    \ides{Sub-Prefix Hijacking}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item More specific prefix is announced
                            \item Longest prefix matching selects the most specific prefix
                            \item Bogus route is picked up by everyone
                        \end{itemize}
                    \icon Difficult to detect and debug
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Often, no loss of connectivity but only performance degradation
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item Requirements

                                \begin{itemize}
                                    \item Configuration mistake
                                    \item Operator himself launches the attack
                                    \item Outsider breaks into

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Monitoring BGP update messages and use history to detect anomalies in the router's behaviour
                    \icon High probability for false positive

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Soft response to suspicious routes
                    \item Prefer routes that were used in the past and delay adoption of unfamiliar routes when possible
                    \ipro Attacks will go away over time
                    \ipro Gives operators time to investigate
                    \item Why is this good enough?
                    \item How well would it work?

    \item Data Plane Attacks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Routers should forward packets along the path chosen by the control plane
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item No checking mechanism
                \end{itemize}
            \item Attacker must get access of a router along the path (or hijack a prefix)

                            \item Hard to detect

                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Packages can be snooped
                            \item After they are forwarded along the right path
                            \item Hard to detect

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Adversary must control a route along the path or hijack prefix
                    \item How to gain control of a router
                \end{itemize}
            \item Drop packets in the data plane
            \item Easier to evade detection
            \item Evade easier if you just slow done some traffic


        \end{itemize}
    \item BGO is Very hard to fix
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Complex system
            \item Hard to reach agreement on the right solution
            \item Hard to deploy
