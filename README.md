# ETH Resources
---

This repository contains notes, summaries, exam cheatsheets and other resources I have been creating for my BsC at ETH Zurich. They are written in the language of the course. All resources are based on primary sources like the lecture, slides, provided scripts and mandatory and recommended readings. None of the resources has been proof-read and certainly they contains many mistakes and errors. You are very welcome to report or fix them in a PR.

The repo contains all sources as well precompiled PDFs. Though, I cannot guarantee that the PDFs always reflect the latest changes to the source
