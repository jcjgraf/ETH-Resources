\section{Views}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It an alias for a query
    \item Provides higher abstraction than relations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides logical data independence
        \end{itemize}
    \item Can be used similarly as a table
    \item Used for
        \begin{itemize}
            \ides{Privacy:} Give person access to a limited view and not the whole relation/DB
            \ides{Usability:} Simplify queries
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Create view:} \verb+CREATE VIEW <NAME> AS <SQL QUERY>+
    \item DMDB convert statement containing a view into a statement without view
    \ides{Update View}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For base relation $R_1, \dots , R_n$ and view $V = Q(R_1, \dots , R_n)$
            \item Update $V$ into $V'$ requires finding a set of updated to the base relation $R'_1, \dots ,R'_n)$ s.t. $Q(R'_1, \dots , R'_n) = V'$
            \item Not all view can be updated
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Some data is missing
                    \item Primary key is missing
                    \item etc.
                \end{itemize}
            \item SQL view is updatable iff:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Involved only one base relation
                    \item Involves the key of that base relation
                    \item Does no involve aggregates, group by or duplicate-elimination
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
