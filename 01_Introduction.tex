    \ides{Internet:} Network of networks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Enormously complex
            \item We consider a abstraction
            \item A network is graph with nodes and edged:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \ides{Node:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \ides{Capacity:} How much data can they transfer at a given time?

                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resources Sharing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Links are shared among users
    \ides{Oversubscribe:} Assumed that not all user will use it at the same time 
    \item Terminology
        \begin{itemize}
            \ides{P:} Peak rate
            \ides{A:} Average rate
            \ides{A/P:} Level of utilisation
        \end{itemize}
    \item Two main principles
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Circuit Switching/Reservation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reserve the bandwidth $P$ for all switches on the path in advance
    \item Only required $A/P$
    \item Good when $P/A$ small
    \item Multiplexed at flow-level
    \item Two different methods
    \ides{Time-base:} Periodic timeslots which are reserved
    \ides{Frequency-base:} Specific frequencies are reserved
    \item Both methods can be combined
    \ipro Predictable performance
    \icon Does not routes around failed switches
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Setup of new path required
        \end{itemize}
    \icon Long setup and take down of the link
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Not suited for short communication
        \end{itemize}
    \item Used in phone networks
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Packet Switching/On-Demand}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Send data when needed
    \item Good when $P/A$ large
    \item Multiplexed at packet-level
    \ipro Efficient use of resource
    \ipro Routes around failed switches
    \icon Unpredictable performance
    \icon Packets can clash
    \icon Network can ``overflow'' (congestion)
    \item Used by the internet
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Layer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network is structured in $5$ layer
    \item Each layer has its protocols
    \item Each layer builds on a service provided by the lower layer
    \item Each layer provides a service to the upper layer
    \item OSI model has $7$ layers
    \ides{Physical Layer:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides physical transfer of bits
            \item Moves \textit{bits}
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Link Layer:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides local best-effort delivery
            \item Moves \textit{frames}
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Network Layer:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides global best-effort delivery
            \item Moves \textit{packet}
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Transport Layer:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides end-to-end delivery (reliable of not)
            \item Transports \textit{segments}
        \end{itemize}
    \ides{Application Layer:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides network access
            \item Exchanges \textit{messages}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Each layer adds its own header to the message before transmitting it to the lower level
    \item Different devices implement different layers
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Host implements all layers
            \item Router implements up to L3
            \item Switch implements up to L2
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{End-To-End Principle}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network is unreliable, but try to make it as reliable as possible
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Else we have many end-to-end retries
        \end{itemize}
    \item End-to-end check \textbf{always} necessary 
    \ides{Fate-Sharing Principle:} Acceptable to loose state but only if the entity is lost too
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Store state always co-local to entities
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Characteristics and Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network is characterized by delay, loss and throughput
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Delay}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total delay is sum of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \ides{Transmission Delay}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Time to push all bits onto the link
                    \item $\text{transmission delay [sec]} = \frac{\text{packet size [\# bits]}}{\text{line bandwith [\# bits/sec]}}$
                    \item Due to link properties
                \end{itemize}
            \ides{Propagation Delay}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Time for a bit to travel through the link
                    \item $\text{Propagation delay [sec]} = \frac{\text{link length [m]}}{\text{propagation speed [m/sec]}}$
                    \item Propagation speed is a fraction of $c$ (speed of light)
                    \item Due to link properties
                \end{itemize}
            \ides{Processing Delay}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Time to process a request
                    \item Due to traffic and switch internals
                    \item Tiny; can be neglected
                \end{itemize}
            \ides{Queuing Delay}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Time a packet waits in the buffer for transmission
                    \item Varies from packet to packet
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Hard to predict
                            \item Analysis requires statistical measures
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item Depends on:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Arrival rate of new pack
                            \item Transmission rate of outgoing link
                            \item Traffic burstiness
                        \end{itemize}
                    \ides{Analysis}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \ides{a [packets/sec]:} average packet arrival rate
                            \ides{R [bit/sec]:} transmission rate on outgoing link
                            \ides{L [bit]:} fixed packet length
                            \ides{La [bit/sec]:} average bits arrival rate
                            \ides{La/R:} traffic intensity
                            \item Queuing delay is exponential with increasing traffic intensity 
                            \item Diverges at $1$
                            \item Increases fast if traffic is bursty
                            \item Goal: operate far from critical point
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item Due to traffic and switch internals
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Cannot predict which delay dominates
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Loss}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Queue can hold at most $N$ packets in their buffer
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N + 1$ packet gets dropped
        \end{itemize}
    \item Upper bound $= N \cdot L / R$
    \item Loss may be acceptable of not
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can resend redundant information as $A, B, A \oplus B$
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Throughput}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rate at which a host receives data
    \item $\text{Average throughput [\# bits/sec]} = \frac{\text{data size [\# bits]}}{\text{transfer time [sec]}}$
    \item End-to-end throughput is the throughput of the bottleneck
\end{itemize}
