        \end{itemize}
    \item There are many other flavours of ER
    \ides{Design Principles}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Model should reflect the application we want to build
            \item Avoid redundancy
            \item Keep it as simple as possible; less entities is better
            \item Entity if the concept has more than one relationship
            \item Attribute if the concept has only one 1:1 relationship
            \item Models are large, partition it
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical Modelling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Take ER-model and convert to relational model
    \item Some constraints get lost
    \ides{Steps}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \ides{Entity Sets:} Become relations
            \ides{Attributes:} Become attributes of the relation
            \ides{Relationship:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \ides{Without Cardinality Constrain (or N:M):}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Become relation containing the attributes of all participating relations
                            \item The primary key of the relation are all the primary keys together
                        \end{itemize}
                    \ides{With Cardinality Constraints:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Very tricky
                            \item Become relation containing the attributes of all participating relations
                            \item The primary key of the relation are the keys of the entities with which the relation can be uniquely identified.Or the relation gets merged into the table on the \textit{many} side.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \ides{Role:} Can be used to distinguish columns with the same entity type.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Done by renaming the two columns appropriately
                        \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \ides{Weak Entity:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Can be omitted
                    \item The week entity is modeled as a relation on its own with the primary key of the main relation and its own key
                \end{itemize}
            \ides{Generalisation:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Two ways to represent this
                    \item Better way depends on application
                    \item[1)] \textit{Child} has its own relation and the \textit{Parent} relation
                    \item[2)] Each \textit{Child} is a full blown relation containing all keys of the \textit{parent} relation
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \icon Lot of redundant data if entity is multiple child and parent at the same time
                            \icon Cannot constraint that entity is only on of them
                        \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
    \ides{Rezept}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Convert entries to relations
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item All attributes of the model get attributes of the relation
                    \item All keys of the model get keys of the relation
                \end{itemize}
            \item Convert relations to relations
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item All attributes of the model get attributes of the relation
                    \item All keys of the participating entries are attributes of the relation
                    \item Keys are the keys of the entities which uniquely identify the relation
                    \item Mark alternative keys
                \end{itemize}
            \item Merge relation if it is $1:1, 1:N, N:1$ and it has the same key
            \item Do some other merging
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Automatically generates at least 3NF
        \end{itemize}
    \item Can be done (Semi-) automatically
\end{itemize}
