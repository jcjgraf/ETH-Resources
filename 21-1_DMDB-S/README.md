Lecture summary for the *Data Modelling and Databases* class, held by Prof. Ce Zhang in FS 2021.

You can get a pre-compiled version of the summary [here](./main_final.pdf). However, I suggest you to rather compile it yourself to make sure that it really contains all the lastest changes.

## Disclaimer
This summary has not been proof-read and certainly contains many typos and errors. Further, it is not guaranteed to contain all material covered in the designated lecture. Do not hesitate to report them to me or fix them yourself and create a PR.
